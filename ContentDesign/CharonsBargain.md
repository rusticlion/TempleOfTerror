Charon's Bargain
A Mothership RPG One-Shot Adventure

Scenario Overview
The Players receive a dubious distress signal from the cargo freighter _Styx 
Transporter_. Upon investigation, they discover a vessel adrift, its 
systems failing, and stalked by a horrific biological entity. The ship 
houses a secret lab where Dr. Aris Thorne, driven by grief and denial, has 
been using a dangerous alien artifact – the Vitalizing Field Emitter 
(VFE) – in a desperate attempt to save her catastrophically injured 
husband, Alex. This endeavor has had horrific consequences, transforming 
him into a monstrous "Hydra" and warping other life on board.

Core Themes
Denial's Price: How the refusal to accept tragedy can lead to its 
monstrous metastasis.
Body Horror: The grotesque and terrifying transformations inflicted by the 
VFE.
Ethical Despair: Forcing players to confront impossible choices with no 
truly "good" outcomes.
Unknowable Horrors: The dangers of meddling with alien technology beyond 
human comprehension.
Background: What Happened Here?
The Mission: The _Styx_ was on a covert mission to retrieve and 
study an Artifact of immense power, later designated the Vitalizing Field 
Emitter (VFE), believed to originate from the hyperintelligent AI 
"Empress" or its autonomous factories. Dr. Aris Thorne, a brilliant but 
ethically flexible scientist, was key to this mission, hoping the VFE 
could revolutionize medical science.
The Accident: During or shortly after the VFE's retrieval, a containment 
breach or accidental activation occurred. The Artifact emitted a powerful 
energy pulse, catastrophically injuring many crew members, including Dr. 
Thorne’s husband, Alex, and damaging the ship's reactor.
A Desperate Bargain: Faced with Alex's imminent death, Dr. Thorne 
activated the VFE, whose primary known function was rapid biological 
regeneration. Initially, it seemed to work, mending his grievous wounds. 
However, the healing was chaotic and uncontrolled.
Escalation of Horror: The VFE, being an alien artifact of unknown 
complexity, began to draw excessive power, causing ship-wide power surges 
and reactor instability. These surges amplified the VFE's effects. Alex’s 
body warped with each regenerative cycle, becoming less human and more 
monstrous—a "Hydra" of flesh and bone. The VFE’s influence also spread, 
causing minor mutations in other organic matter and residual fauna (like 
rats) aboard the _Styx_.
The Distress Signal: As the situation deteriorated, Security Officer Elias 
Ward attempted to send a distress signal for evacuation. Dr. Thorne, deep 
in her denial and convinced she could still "save" Alex, altered the 
signal to indicate a medical emergency, hoping to lure personnel who could help her 
control the VFE.
Fractured Survivors: The remaining crew fractured. Some, like Ward, 
focused on containment. Dr. Lauren Ng, Thorne’s research assistant, grew 
horrified but was initially too intimidated or conflicted to act 
decisively against Thorne. Engineer Marcus Hardy, exposed to the VFE's 
energies while trying to manage the failing reactor, suffered mutations.
The Hydra's Birth: In a final, desperate act to "stabilize" Alex, Dr. 
Thorne pushed the VFE to its limits. This resulted in Alex's complete 
transformation into the Hydra, a constantly-regenerating, flesh-warped monstrosity,
barely contained within the ship’s Test Chamber.
Current State: The _Styx Transporter_ drifts, a tomb-ship caught in a cycle 
of power surges that fuel the VFE. Dr. Thorne remains in her hidden VFE 
Lab, obsessively tending to the Artifact and the monstrosity in the Test 
Chamber, blind to the reality of her failure.
Key NPCs
Dr. Aris Thorne: Brilliant, obsessed, and dangerously deluded. She will do 
anything to protect the VFE and what she believes is her husband's only 
chance. She is likely in the VFE Lab.
The Hydra (Alex Thorne): Once Dr. Thorne’s husband, now a 
grotesque, multi-appendaged horror that regenerates and adapts. It is 
unkillable as long as the VFE is active. Located in the Test Chamber.
Dr. Lauren Ng: Research assistant to Dr. Thorne. Traumatized and 
conflicted, she understands the VFE's danger but is afraid of Dr. Thorne 
and the Hydra. May possess crucial information about the VFE and hidden 
labs. Likely found in the Medical Wing.
Elias Ward: Security Officer. Paranoid and potentially hostile. Blames Dr. 
Thorne for the disaster. May know about ship systems or other survivors. 
(Location: GM's discretion, perhaps barricaded in Crew Quarters or 
Engineering/Maintenance).
Marcus Hardy: Engineer. Severely mutated by VFE exposure but may have 
moments of lucidity. Knowledgeable about the ship's failing reactor and power 
systems. Single-handedly holding back total warp reactor meltdown. (Location: Likely near Engineering/Maintenance).
The Vitalizing Field Equipment (VFE)
The VFE is an alien Artifact of unknown origin, connected to a mysterious entity 
codenamed "Empress".

Primary Effect: Induces rapid, chaotic biological regeneration and 
adaptation in organic matter. Highly effective in preserving life.
Side Effects: Causes grotesque mutations, unpredictable mental changes, 
and can warp existing lifeforms into new, hostile configurations. 
Prolonged exposure is highly dangerous.
Power Dependency: Its effects are amplified by power surges from the 
ship's failing reactor.
Player Interaction: Attempts to use or understand it are perilous. Injured 
players exposed to its field may find wounds healing in bizarre, 
detrimental ways (e.g., an arm regrows as a useless tendril, skin hardens 
into brittle plates, new sensory organs sprout). This can lead to stat 
penalties, new vulnerabilities, or even partial loss of character control.
Player Objectives
Survive: The _Styx_ is a death trap. The Hydra, mutated 
creatures, environmental hazards, and the VFE itself pose constant 
threats.
Save (Maybe): Can anyone truly be saved? Players must decide how to deal 
with Dr. Thorne. Is it possible to convince her to abandon her efforts? 
Are there other survivors who can be rescued?
Solve: Uncover the truth behind the distress signal and the catastrophe 
that befell the _Styx_. The ultimate goal is likely to 
neutralize the threat, which primarily means deactivating the VFE.
Pacing and Structure (Three Acts)
Act 1: Arrival and Initial Exploration

Objective: Establish the eerie mystery and the immediate dangers.
Scenes: Docking, initial exploration of seemingly abandoned corridors, 
flickering lights, strange noises (breathing from vents, skittering).
Clues: Distress signal irregularities, signs of struggle, unsettling 
graffiti ("He’s still in there," "Trust the VFE, it will work"). Early 
logs hinting at an "accident" and "experimental treatment."
Encounters: Minor environmental hazards (electrical sparks, malfunctioning 
doors), corrupted maintenance droids, first sight of minor VFE mutations 
(e.g., Amalgamated Rats).
Pacing: Build tension slowly. Use omens and foreshadowing. A countdown to 
the next major power surge could introduce early time pressure.
Act 2: The Lab and the Revelation

Objective: Uncover the truth about Dr. Thorne, her husband, and the VFE. 
Confront the moral dilemma.
Scenes: Discovering the Medical Wing, encountering Dr. Ng, finding 
evidence of the VFE's true nature, locating the hidden VFE Lab.
Clues: Medical data showing grotesque regeneration, Dr. Ng’s testimony, 
Dr. Thorne's research notes in the VFE lab detailing her descent into 
obsession and the VFE's connection to Empress.
Encounters: More significant mutated crew members. Confrontation with Dr. 
Thorne, who will plead for help or react hostilely if players attempt to 
interfere with the VFE.
Dilemma: Dr. Thorne may offer assistance or information in exchange for 
"helping" stabilize Alex. Do the players feign cooperation, confront her, 
or seek another way to disable the VFE?
Pacing: Increase encounters with VFE-affected elements. Emphasize body 
horror. Choices should have immediate consequences.
Act 3: Showdown and Resolution

Objective: Confront the Scranton-Hydra and make a final decision about the 
VFE.
Climax: The Scranton-Hydra breaks full containment (if it hasn't already) 
or is intentionally unleashed/interacted with when players access the Test 
Chamber. The ship becomes increasingly unstable due to reactor and VFE 
feedback loops.
Key Challenge: Reaching the VFE controls (likely in the VFE Lab) or the 
main reactor controls (Engineering/Maintenance) to shut it/them down, all 
while evading or dealing with the Hydra.
Escalation: The Hydra grows more dangerous if fought directly while the 
VFE is active, possibly regenerating limbs or developing new attacks. The 
VFE field itself might intensify.
Resolution Options:
Deactivation: Shutting down the VFE. This will cause the Scranton-Hydra to 
(eventually) die, effectively "killing" Alex Thorne. This is the most 
direct way to end the threat.
Destroy the Ship: A desperate measure if deactivation fails.
Escape: Players might choose to flee, leaving the Styx Transporter and its 
horrors adrift (a terrible outcome for the wider universe).
Impossible Salvation (GM Discretion): Saving Alex is designed to be 
virtually impossible. The horror lies in the realization that he is too 
far gone.
Pacing: High-octane. The environment should be actively working against 
the players. Dr. Thorne might make a final, desperate appeal or attempt to 
sabotage the players.

             [10. Escape Pods] <---> [8. Test Chamber (Hidden)]
Keyed Locations:

Docking Bay

Atmosphere: Cold, echoing. Emergency lights flicker. The airlock hisses 
intermittently.
Interactables:
Emergency Beacon: Damaged panel. Close inspection (Electronics or 
Mechanical Repair roll) reveals manual override and signs of hasty, bloody 
work. Last message fragment: "...med emergency...Dr. Thorne requests 
immediate..."
Cargo Loader: Slumped, inactive. Can be reactivated (requires power 
rerouting or successful Tinker roll) to move heavy objects or as a 
clumsy weapon.
Hazards/Encounters:
Power Fluctuations: Random sparks from damaged conduits.

Main Corridor

Atmosphere: Long, shadowy. Patches of strange, pulsating slime on walls. 
The distant sound of the failing reactor.
Interactables:
Graffiti: Scrawled messages: "HE'S STILL IN THERE - A.T.", "TRUST THE 
VFE", "DON'T LET HER NEAR THE REACTOR". Some appear frantically rewritten.
Security Panel: Mostly fried. May offer a partial ship schematic if 
repaired (difficult Electronics roll).
Hazards/Encounters:
Amalgamated Rats: A skittering carpet of fused rats, jaws snapping. Low 
individual threat, but dangerous in a swarm.
Flickering Lights: Can cause disorientation or provide cover for threats.

Crew Quarters

Atmosphere: Stale air, personal belongings strewn about. Some doors 
sealed, others broken open.
Interactables:
Personal Logs (Datapads/Terminals): Offer glimpses of crew fear, Dr. 
Thorne's increasing isolation, and early VFE experiments. One log might 
mention "unauthorized modifications near Cargo Bay." (Possible location of 
Elias Ward).
Lockers/Bunks: Potential for minor supplies (ration packs, basic tools, 
stun baton).
Hazards/Encounters:
Mutated Crew Member (Lurker): Hiding, movements jerky. May be docile until 
startled or if players carry VFE-affected items. Not overtly hostile, but 
terrified and unpredictable.

Medical Wing

Atmosphere: Antiseptic smell mixed with something metallic and rotting. 
Overturned gurneys, smashed medical monitors.
NPC: Dr. Lauren Ng may be found here, hiding or attempting to analyze 
samples. She is terrified but may share information if handled with care, 
especially about the VFE Lab's existence and how to access it (e.g., "Dr. 
Thorne sealed it off... used to be a service tunnel in Cargo... her old 
access codes might still work...").
Interactables:
Autodoc Pod: Bloodstained. A terminal shows it was being modified to 
interface with "External Regenerative Field." Using it for healing is 
risky: roll on a VFE side-effect table.
Research Terminal: Contains Dr. Ng's logs, early VFE data (before Thorne 
locked her out), theories on the VFE's energy draw.
Hazards/Encounters: Discarded biological samples may show minor, twitching 
signs of VFE influence.

Hydroponics Bay

Atmosphere: Humid, strangely overgrown. Plants are mutated—too large, 
oddly colored, some with twitching vine-like growths. Not actively hostile 
but unsettling.
Interactables:
Water Filtration Controls: Could be used to flush specific connected areas 
with (possibly contaminated) water as a distraction.
Plant Samples: Taking samples might reveal the VFE’s pervasive influence.
Hazards/Encounters: The air is thick with spores; exposure 
without filters might induce minor irritation or hallucinations.

Cargo Bay

Atmosphere: Vast, cluttered with containers. Some are breached, spilling 
mundane supplies mixed with VFE-warped material.
Interactables:
Sealed Containers: Some marked "BIOLOGICAL EXPERIMENTS - HANDLE WITH 
EXTREME CAUTION."
Forklift/Crane: Damaged but potentially repairable (Tinker roll).
Hidden Access (VFE Lab): A specific section of wall/floor appears on no 
official schematic. Dr. Ng might hint at it, or a thorough search 
(Survey) reveals a cleverly disguised maintenance 
hatch or panel. Requires Dr. Thorne's old access code (from Ng, or a 
datapad in Crew Quarters) or a difficult Tinker/Wreck roll to bypass.
Hazards/Encounters: Mutated insects or vermin might scuttle amongst the 
cargo.

VFE Lab (Hidden)

Access: Via hidden hatch in Cargo Bay.
Atmosphere: Cramped, humming with energy. Makeshift wiring snakes 
everywhere, leading to the central VFE console. The air thrums, causing 
teeth to ache.
NPC: Dr. Aris Thorne is here, obsessively monitoring the VFE. She’ll react 
defensively to any attempt to shut it down.
Interactables:
VFE Control Terminal: Allows direct interaction with the Artifact. 
Displays chaotic energy readings and biological feedback from the Test 
Chamber. Attempting to understand or control it is extremely difficult and 
dangerous. This is the primary way to deactivate the VFE. Contains 
Thorne’s detailed (and increasingly unhinged) logs about Alex and Empress.
Emergency Override (Test Chamber): A heavily secured panel to open/seal 
the Test Chamber door. Thorne will fight to prevent access.
Hazards/Encounters: The ambient VFE field is stronger here. Unprotected 
players may suffer minor mutations or ill effects.

Test Chamber (Hidden)

Access: Via a heavily secured blast door from the VFE Lab.
Atmosphere: A nightmarish charnel house. Walls are slick with organic 
residue. The air is thick with the stench of chemicals and warped flesh. 
The Hydra is a terrifying presence, bound to a modified operating table by frayed restraints.
Primary Threat: The Scranton-Hydra (Alex Thorne). A massive, multi-limbed, 
multi-sensory horror. It constantly regenerates, adapts, and may display 
remnants of human intelligence in its tactics. It is effectively immortal 
while the VFE is active.
Interactables:
Environmental Controls: Damaged panels that once controlled 
temperature/atmosphere. Might be briefly usable to cause the Hydra 
discomfort or temporary weakness if repaired.
Observation Window (to VFE Lab): Thick, likely cracked or stained.
Hazards/Encounters: The Hydra. The entire room is a biohazard.

Engineering/Maintenance

Atmosphere: Loud with the groan of the dying reactor. Hot, sparks fly. 
Smells of ozone and burning metal.
NPC: Marcus Hardy (mutated engineer) might be found here, trying to keep 
the reactor from melting down, or babbling incoherently.
Interactables:
Reactor Status Terminal: Shows critical warnings. Indicates periodic power 
surges that feed the VFE. Skilled players might attempt to initiate a 
controlled shutdown or (dangerously) overload it.
Power Relay Controls: Damaged. Could be used to reroute power, possibly 
cutting it to specific sections (including the VFE Lab, with difficulty 
and risk).
Hazards/Encounters: Reactor leaks (radiation/energy), unstable flooring, 
electrical arcs. Marcus Hardy, if hostile.
Corrupted Maintenance Droid: Its optical sensors are overgrown with 
twitching organic matter. Erratic, may attack with tools or ram.

Escape Pods

Atmosphere: Relatively clean, but with an air of desperation. Some pods 
are launched, others damaged.
Interactables:
Pod Launch Controls: Some pods may require power or codes to launch.
Emergency Supplies: Medkits, O2 tanks, flares.
Hazards/Encounters: A lone, heavily mutated survivor who failed to launch 
a pod might be here, catatonic or hostile.

Omens & Foreshadowing

Flickering lights synched with a distant, rhythmic thumping.
Whispers or pained breathing heard through vents.
Sudden temperature drops in certain corridors.
Objects vanishing or being subtly moved when players aren't looking.
Patches of rapidly growing, pulsating organic matter on walls.
Dreams/hallucinations if players rest (related to drowning, being remade, 
or Charon).

Threats & Creatures

The Hydra: The primary threat. Stats should be formidable, 
emphasizing its regenerative capabilities and adaptive attacks (e.g., 
sprouting new limbs, spitting acid, hardened hide). Unkillable unless the 
VFE is deactivated.
Mutated Crew Members: Former humans, twisted by the VFE. Varying degrees 
of hostility and retained intelligence. Some may be pitiful, others 
aggressive.
Amalgamated Rats: Swarms of rats fused into larger, multi-limbed vermin.
Corrupted Maintenance Droids: Ship systems given a horrifying biological 
bent.
Environmental Hazards: Electrical arcing, reactor leaks, VFE field 
hotspots causing rapid, localized mutations.

Time Pressure Mechanics

Destabilizing Reactor Core: The ship's reactor is failing, leading to 
periodic power surges. Each surge:
Temporarily boosts the VFE's effects (Hydra becomes more active/dangerous, 
mutations accelerate).
Causes ship-wide system malfunctions (doors lock/unlock, lights fail, 
gravity fluctuations).
Warden should track this, perhaps with a d6 countdown to the next surge.
VFE Feedback Loop: As the reactor destabilizes further, the VFE itself 
might enter a runaway feedback loop, making its ambient effects 
increasingly pervasive and dangerous for everyone on board. This acts as a 
soft "time limit" for the players to resolve the situation before the 
entire ship becomes an unlivable, mutating hellscape.

Potential Resolutions & Aftermath

VFE Deactivated, Hydra "Dies": Alex Thorne is finally at peace. Dr. 
Thorne's reaction can range from catatonia to violent despair. Players 
might escape with logs detailing the horrors of Empress artifacts.
Ship Destroyed: A pyrrhic victory. The threat is neutralized, but all 
evidence and potential survivors are lost.
Players Escape, VFE Active: The Styx Transporter becomes a drifting plague 
ship, a future hook for another adventure or a grim note of failure.
Dr. Thorne "Saved": Highly unlikely, but if players somehow manage to 
subdue her and drag her off the ship while the VFE is still active (or its 
deactivation leads to her mental collapse), her fate is a grim loose end.
A New Hydra: If a player character becomes too mutated by the VFE, they 
might become a new, less controlled "Hydra," especially if the original is 
destroyed but the VFE remains active.
