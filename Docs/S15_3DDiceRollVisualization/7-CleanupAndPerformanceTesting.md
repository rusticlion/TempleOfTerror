Task 7: Cleanup and Performance Testing
Description: Remove obsolete 2D dice code, ensure the 3D dice view performs well, and clean up any debugging aids.

Actions:

Remove Old 2D Dice Code:
Delete the Image(systemName: "die.face...") rendering logic from DiceRollView.swift.
Remove unused @State variables related to 2D dice animations (diceOffsets, diceRotations, potentially diceValues if SceneKitDiceView manages its own state completely).
Performance Profiling:
Test the 3D dice roll on various target devices, especially with the maximum number of dice.
Profile using Xcode's tools to identify any performance bottlenecks (e.g., overly complex physics shapes, too many draw calls).
Optimize die models/textures or physics settings if necessary.
Disable Debug Features:
Turn off allowsCameraControl in the SCNView if it was enabled for debugging.
Remove any print statements or temporary debug overlays.
