Task 5: Full Integration with DiceRollView and GameViewModel
Description: Connect the 3D dice rolling mechanism completely into the DiceRollView's state flow and ensure results are correctly passed back to the GameViewModel.

Actions:

Modify DiceRollView.swift State Management:
The isRolling state will now represent the 3D dice actively rolling.
The stopShaking() method's primary responsibility will shift:
It will be called (or its logic adapted) once SceneKitDiceView signals that the 3D dice have settled and results are available.
It will fetch the actualDiceRolled array from SceneKitDiceView.
It will then proceed to call viewModel.performAction(...) with these 3D results.
The rest of stopShaking() (setting self.result, highlightIndex, fadeOthers, popDie, showOutcome) will use the data derived from the 3D roll.
Adapt DiceRollView.onAppear:
Still needs to calculate projection and determine diceCount.
This diceCount should be passed to SceneKitDiceView to initialize the correct number of 3D dice.
The 2D diceValues, diceOffsets, diceRotations arrays can likely be removed or repurposed if not used for any other preliminary display.
Ensure DiceRollResult is Populated Correctly:
The actualDiceRolled: [Int]? field in DiceRollResult (returned by viewModel.performAction) will now be populated by the values read from the 3D dice. GameViewModel doesn't need to change its expectation of this data.
