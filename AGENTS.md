This is a SwiftUI codebase for an iOS dungeon crawl game. See the PRD in Docs for an overview of the project.

You will typically be assigned a ticket to complete from a sprint folder in the /Docs directory.

Alternatively, you may be given a bug description to address.

If we will need to add an asset to the project that you can't create yourself (like a .png or .wav) in order to implement a feature, add a placeholder Markdown document to /AssetPlaceholders, detailing the expectations of the asset to be created. Do not attempt to directly modify the contents of the /Assets/xcassets directory.
